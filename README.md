## What is Lair?

Lair enables organizations to deploy **private AI infrastructure** with comprehensive **process automation capabilities** on Kubernetes. The default architecture is fully self-hosted for data sovereignty and control; optional external AI providers can be enabled when needed.

---

## Why Private AI Matters

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/private-ai-for-enterprise.png" alt="LAiR — Private AI Infrastructure for Enterprise">
</p>

When you use a Big closed AI provider, your data — documents, code, customer records — goes to someone else's servers. You can't control where it's stored or how it's used.

**LAiR changes that.** It gives you the same AI tools, but running on infrastructure you control. Privacy depends on how you deploy:

- **LAN / On-premises** (DGX Spark or PC with GPU) — Everything runs locally. Models, data, and automations stay on your hardware. Zero data leaves your network.
- **Datacenter / Cloud** (VM or managed Kubernetes) — Your data stays within your controlled environment. If no GPU is available, LAiR can use external LLM providers for inference. In this case, choose providers carefully: **European providers** are recommended for GDPR compliance, and since multiple users share the same API endpoint, there is no individual profiling.

### What do you need to do?

Deploy LAiR on a server you control — a physical machine in your office, a VM in the cloud, an edge device, or even a desktop workstation like NVIDIA DGX Spark. See [Quick Start](#quick-start) for installation instructions.

### What do you get?

- **A private ChatGPT** — A web interface (OpenWebUI) where your team can chat with AI, upload documents, search knowledge bases, all running locally
- **Local LLMs** — Open-source models served by Ollama on your own GPU, from small and fast to 200B+ parameters on DGX Spark
- **External LLM support** — When no GPU is available, connect to open-source model providers (e.g. OVH AI Endpoints). Choose European providers for GDPR compliance. No user profiling — the API is shared, not tied to individual accounts.
- **Workflow automation** — N8N with 400+ integrations to connect AI to your ERP, CRM, databases, email, and more
- **Document intelligence** — Upload PDFs, Word files, spreadsheets. LAiR extracts and indexes them for AI-powered search (RAG)
- **Image generation** — ComfyUI for AI-generated images, running on your GPU
- **Your own SSO** — Log in with your company credentials (Azure AD, Google, OIDC)
- **Full control** — Every component runs on your infrastructure. No vendor lock-in, no per-token billing.

### Who is it for?

| If you are... | LAiR helps you... |
|---------------|-------------------|
| A company handling sensitive data (healthcare, finance, legal, government) | Use AI without violating compliance rules or sending data outside |
| A team that wants to automate internal processes | Build AI-powered workflows that connect to your existing systems |
| An organization already running Kubernetes | Add a complete AI stack to your existing cluster |
| Deploying at the edge (retail, manufacturing, IoT) | Run AI where your data is generated, not in a distant cloud |
| Tired of unpredictable AI costs | Pay for hardware once, use AI unlimited — no per-token billing |

### How do you use it?

1. **Deploy** — Follow the [Quick Start](#quick-start) guide to install LAiR on your server.
2. **Access** — Open the web UI at `ai.your-domain.local` (or your public domain). Log in with your company SSO or local credentials.
3. **Chat** — Start talking to AI. Pick a model, upload documents, ask questions.
4. **Automate** — Open N8N, build workflows that connect AI to your business tools — no coding required.
5. **Scale** — Add more nodes, more GPUs, more models. LAiR grows with your needs.

> **In short:** LAiR lets you run a complete AI platform on your own terms. Same power as cloud AI, but your data stays yours, your costs are predictable, and you're in full control.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Minimum | Recommended |
|-------------|---------|-------------|
| **OS** | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS | Ubuntu 24.04 LTS / DGX OS |
| **CPU** | 4 cores | 8+ cores |
| **RAM** | 8 GB | 16+ GB |
| **Storage** | 100 GB free | 200+ GB free |
| **Access** | Root/sudo | Root/sudo |

> **8 GB RAM limitation:** The 8 GB tier is only supported if you disable local models (Ollama) and image generation (ComfyUI).

### Simplified Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# 1. Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/Lair-ai/lair.git
cd lair

# 2. Run the interactive setup wizard
sudo ./setup.sh
```

> **WARNING:** The setup wizard performs system-level changes including installing Kubernetes, creating persistent volumes, and configuring networking. **Do not run this on a production system without first reviewing the scripts and understanding the impact.** Always test in a non-critical environment first. See [Current Limitations](#current-limitations) for known issues.

**The setup wizard will:**
- Welcome you and explain the process
- Ask whether you want to setup a cluster or deploy Lair
- Guide you through cluster choice (managed vs local MicroK8s)
- Run the appropriate setup scripts interactively
- Handle the complete setup process step by step

**That's it!** Your private AI infrastructure is ready with guided assistance.

> **Backup & Restore:** LAiR includes [Velero](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero) for automated backup and disaster recovery. Cluster resources and persistent volumes can be backed up to S3-compatible storage and restored when needed. See [Backup & Disaster Recovery](docs/maintenance/backup-restore.md) for details.

---

## Installation Paths

The unified setup wizard (`sudo ./setup.sh`) automatically detects your environment and guides you through the appropriate installation path. It supports the following main deployment scenarios:

1. **Local MicroK8s (Recommended)**
   - **Single-node**: Perfect for development, cloud VMs, edge computing (Jetson), and DGX Spark.
   - **Multi-node**: Setup a primary node and secondary workers for production/high availability.
2. **Managed Kubernetes (Enterprise)**
   - Deploy on existing clusters like OVH MKS, EKS, GKE, or AKS.

For advanced users who prefer manual execution or need granular control over each step, detailed guides and scripts are available in the [Installation Documentation](docs/installation/).

<p align="center">
  <img src="docs/assets/installation-paths.png" alt="LAiR Installation Paths">
</p>

> **Note 1:** The DGX Spark cost of approximately €5,000 is current as of June 2026.
>
> **Note 2:** When installing on a machine without a GPU, you will need to account for token costs from open-source model providers of your choice.

## How to evaluate Lair

The easiest and most cost-effective way to evaluate Lair is using a VPS in the internal data center or in a cloud provider. You will need a couple of subdomain names and an external AI provider (we recommend OVH or equivalent open-source Provider)

Please, follow instructions in the [Tutorial to start](docs/Tutorial%20to%20Start.md) to deploy Lair on a VPS


## Edge AI & Desktop Supercomputing: NVIDIA Jetson & DGX Spark

LAiR runs on compact edge devices (NVIDIA Jetson) and desktop AI systems (NVIDIA DGX Spark), enabling production-grade AI workflows outside traditional datacenters.

### NVIDIA DGX Spark — Desktop AI Supercomputer

The DGX Spark is powered by the **NVIDIA GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip** and brings datacenter-class AI compute to a Mac mini-sized desktop form factor. Lair is validated to run on DGX Spark, enabling very high‑end single-node private AI deployments.

| Specification | DGX Spark |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Chip** | NVIDIA GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip |
| **CPU** | 20-core ARM (10× Cortex-X925 + 10× Cortex-A725) |
| **GPU** | Blackwell with 5th-gen Tensor Cores |
| **AI Performance** | 1 PFLOP (sparse FP4) |
| **Memory** | 128 GB unified (CPU + GPU shared) |
| **Bandwidth** | 273 GB/s |
| **Max model size** | ~200B parameters (single) / ~405B (two units via ConnectX) |
| **OS** | DGX OS (Ubuntu 24.04-based) |
| **Architecture** | ARM64 |
| **Power** | 240W |

**DGX Spark + Lair: key benefits**

**System Requirements & Hardware Setup**

To ensure optimal performance, stability and proper power management when running LAiR, your DGX Spark operating system, software components and base firmware must be fully up to date. 

You can update these components by following the [official NVIDIA OS and Component Update Guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/dgx/dgx-spark/os-and-component-update.html).

### DGX Spark Quick Start

Run the unified setup wizard directly on your DGX Spark (running DGX OS / Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64). The wizard will guide you through the same installation flow as any other supported Ubuntu host.

### NVIDIA Jetson — Edge AI

For deployments at the network edge, LAiR runs on all NVIDIA Jetson devices with automatic ARM64 optimizations.

### What Runs on Both Platforms

| Component | Jetson | DGX Spark |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| OpenWebUI | ✅ | ✅ |
| N8N | ✅ | ✅ |
| Ollama | ✅ | ✅ *(up to 200B params)* |
| ComfyUI | ✅ | ✅ |
| PostgreSQL | ✅ | ✅ |
| Kubernetes (MicroK8s) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Multi-node clustering | ❌ | ✅ *(via ConnectX)* |

## Quick Commands

### MicroK8s Deployments
```bash
microk8s status # Check system status
kubectl get pods -n lair # View all services
kubectl get ingress -n lair # Check service URLs
kubectl logs -n lair deployment/openwebui # View logs
sudo ./microk8s/teardown.sh # ⚠ DESTROYS all LAiR data, volumes, and namespaces — irreversible
```

### Managed Kubernetes Deployments
```bash
kubectl cluster-info # Check cluster status
kubectl get pods -n lair # View all services
kubectl get ingress -n lair # Check service URLs
kubectl logs -n lair deployment/openwebui # View logs
sudo ./k8s-managed/teardown.sh # ⚠ DESTROYS all LAiR data, volumes, and namespaces — irreversible
```

---

## Current Limitations

### Configuration Update Issues *(Critical)*

`setup.sh` **cannot safely update existing deployments** — it recalculates resources and may attempt to modify immutable PVC specifications, risking data loss.

**Safe Workaround:**
```bash
cd helm-chart
sudo ./setup.sh --config existing-config.yaml # Generate new config
nano values-yourname.yaml # Edit storage sizes manually
helm upgrade lair . -n lair -f values.yaml -f values-yourname.yaml
```

### Jetson Platform Limitations
- NVIDIA Jetson is **single-node only** — no distributed storage or high availability
- Uses Flannel CNI and Hostpath storage (not Longhorn)
- **Workaround**: Use reliable hardware and schedule regular backups

### DGX Spark Considerations
- ARM64 architecture may require additional configuration for some specialized tools and libraries not yet ported to `aarch64`
- DGX OS is the recommended and most thoroughly tested environment; stock Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64 is supported but may need manual driver setup
- Multi-node behavior follows your Kubernetes cluster design, same as other Ubuntu hosts

### No Central Management Dashboard
- Each component is accessed individually via separate URLs
- **Workaround**: Bookmark individual service URLs; use `kubectl` for system management

### OAuth2 Support by Mode
- N8N OAuth2 integrations have **limited functionality in LAN mode** (internal URLs cannot be reached by external OAuth2 providers)
- **Full OAuth2 support** is available in Public mode (Cloud and On-Premises)

---

## Future Roadmap

- **Unified management dashboard** for centralized operations and health checks
- **Safer config updates** to avoid immutable PVC update conflicts during upgrades
- **Expanded platform hardening** for ARM64 and edge deployments
- **Improved docs depth** (installation, operations, and troubleshooting runbooks)
